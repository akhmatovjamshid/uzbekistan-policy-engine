# Uzbekistan Economic Policy Engine — Roadmap

> From prototype to the first AI-enhanced macroeconomic simulation platform for Central Asia.

## Vision

No government or central bank in Central Asia has a **web-native, AI-enhanced, multilingual** macro policy simulation platform. The IMF uses MATLAB/Dynare (desktop-only). The World Bank uses GAMS (license-required). OECD dashboards show data but don't simulate. **We fill that gap.**

**Target users:** Central Bank of Uzbekistan, Ministry of Economy & Finance, CERR, international organization country desks, university economics departments.

## Phase 1: Foundation Hardening (Current → Production-Ready)

**Goal:** Fix critical gaps so the platform can be shown to stakeholders with confidence.

### 1.1 Accessibility (P1)
- [ ] Add `aria-label` to all interactive elements (sliders, buttons, dropdowns)
- [ ] Add `role` attributes to custom controls
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Arrow keys) for all controls
- [ ] Enlarge slider thumbs to 44px for touch targets
- [ ] Color contrast check (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] `lang` attribute updates when switching language

### 1.2 Input Validation & Error Handling (P1)
- [ ] Validate parameter bounds (no negative growth in FPP, no >100% tariffs in PE)
- [ ] Division-by-zero guards in CGE/FPP calculations
- [ ] User-facing toast notifications for network failures (replace silent fallbacks)
- [ ] Solver convergence warnings shown to user (not just console)

### 1.3 Complete i18n (P1)
- [ ] PE model: translate controls, chart labels, sector names
- [ ] IO model: translate table headers, sector names, search placeholders
- [ ] CGE model: translate controls, shock type labels, sector names
- [ ] Externalize all hardcoded English strings in chart configs
- [ ] Translate error/warning messages

### 1.4 Mobile Polish (P2)
- [ ] Horizontal scroll wrappers for data tables (IO, PE)
- [ ] Touch-friendly slider controls (larger hit areas)
- [ ] Test on 375px (iPhone SE) through 1920px
- [ ] Sidebar swipe-to-close on mobile

---

## Phase 2: Scenario Engine & Cross-Model Integration

**Goal:** Transform from 6 isolated models into an integrated policy analysis platform.

### 2.1 Scenario Comparison Dashboard
- [ ] Save simulation snapshots (parameters + results) to localStorage
- [ ] Name and tag scenarios (e.g., "WTO Baseline", "Aggressive Fiscal")
- [ ] Side-by-side chart comparison (2-4 scenarios)
- [ ] Difference tables (Scenario A vs B: delta values)
- [ ] Export comparison as PDF report
- [ ] Scenario library with pre-built policy packages:
  - WTO accession (PE + CGE combined)
  - Fiscal consolidation (FPP + QPM)
  - External shock (commodity price drop across all models)

### 2.2 Cross-Model Linkages
- [ ] QPM output (GDP gap, inflation) feeds into FPP baseline
- [ ] PE tariff changes feed into CGE import prices
- [ ] IO sector multipliers inform CGE calibration
- [ ] DFM nowcast feeds QPM initial conditions
- [ ] Visual "model flow" diagram showing data dependencies

### 2.3 Uncertainty Quantification
- [ ] Fan charts on all forecasts (70%/90% confidence bands)
- [ ] Monte Carlo simulation option for QPM (parameter uncertainty)
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis: tornado diagrams showing which parameters matter most
- [ ] Risk balance indicators (upside vs downside risks)

### 2.4 Data Pipeline
- [ ] Auto-fetch from World Bank API (GDP, inflation, trade)
- [ ] Auto-fetch from IMF WEO API (forecasts)
- [ ] Auto-fetch from CBU API (policy rate, monetary aggregates)
- [ ] Data freshness indicator ("Last updated: 2 days ago")
- [ ] Versioned data snapshots for reproducibility

---

## Phase 3: AI Integration — The Differentiator

**Goal:** Make this the first macro platform where AI explains what the numbers mean.

### 3.1 AI Policy Advisor
- [ ] After any simulation run, generate a plain-language policy brief:
  - "A 5pp tariff reduction on HS 28-40 would increase imports by $X million,
    creating Y jobs in downstream manufacturing but reducing tariff revenue by Z."
- [ ] Contextual recommendations based on simulation results
- [ ] Risk flags: "This scenario implies a current account deficit of X% of GDP,
  which exceeds the IMF threshold for sustainability"
- [ ] Available in EN/RU/UZ

### 3.2 Natural Language Scenario Builder
- [ ] Users describe scenarios in plain text:
  - "What happens if oil drops to $50 and remittances fall 20%?"
  - AI maps this to model parameters and runs the simulation
- [ ] Conversational interface for iterating on scenarios
- [ ] AI suggests relevant follow-up scenarios

### 3.3 Automated Nowcast Narratives
- [ ] DFM nowcast auto-generates monthly economic briefing:
  - "GDP growth is tracking at 6.2% in Q1 2026, driven by strong industrial
    output (+8.1%) but weighed down by declining agricultural production (-1.3%).
    The nowcast has shifted up 0.4pp since last month."
- [ ] Indicator contribution decomposition in plain language
- [ ] Anomaly detection: flag unusual indicator movements

### 3.4 Comparative Intelligence
- [ ] "How does Uzbekistan's current account compare to peer countries at similar
  stages of WTO accession?" — AI retrieves and contextualizes
- [ ] Historical pattern matching: "The last time inflation was this high,
  the CBU raised rates by X and the effect was Y"
- [ ] International best practice suggestions based on simulation results

---

## Phase 4: Platform & Scale

**Goal:** From tool to platform — collaboration, API, and institutional adoption.

### 4.1 Collaboration Features
- [ ] User accounts (view-only vs analyst roles)
- [ ] Shared scenario library across team
- [ ] Comments/annotations on scenarios
- [ ] Audit trail: who changed what assumption, when
- [ ] Quarterly forecasting round workflow (FPAS-style)

### 4.2 New Models
- [ ] **Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)** — IMF framework, stress tests
- [ ] **BVAR Forecasting** — Bayesian VAR with Minnesota/Litterman priors
- [ ] **Agent-Based Model** — Heterogeneous firms/households, distributional effects
- [ ] **Climate-Macro Module** — Carbon pricing, green transition costs
- [ ] **Labor Market Model** — Unemployment, wage dynamics, migration

### 4.3 API & Integration
- [ ] REST API for programmatic access to model outputs
- [ ] Embeddable widgets (iframe charts for reports/presentations)
- [ ] Excel add-in for pulling simulation results into spreadsheets
- [ ] R/Python SDK for researchers

### 4.4 Deployment & Infrastructure
- [ ] Move from static HTML to proper backend (Node.js or Python/FastAPI)
- [ ] Database for scenario storage (PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Authentication (OAuth2 / institutional SSO)
- [ ] CDN deployment for performance
- [ ] Monitoring and usage analytics

**Do first:** Phase 1 fixes + Scenario Comparison + AI Policy Advisor
**Do next:** Cross-model linkages + Uncertainty quantification
**Do later:** Platform features, new models, API

| AI via client-side API calls | Yes | Claude/GPT API from browser, no backend needed initially |
| localStorage for scenarios | Yes | No database needed for Phase 2, upgrade later |
| Add backend at Phase 4 | Yes | Only when collaboration/auth features justify complexity |
